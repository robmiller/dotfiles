# robmiller's dotfiles

They're my dotfiles! I like them! You might not!

Features:

* A battle-hardened vimrc and some great Vim plugins
* Lots of useful Git aliases
* oh-my-zsh with what I think are sensible defaults, plus some useful
  additions
* A nice screenrc with a useful status bar
* Installer for lack-of-manual-symlinking action

## Installation

1. Clone to `~/dotfiles`

2. `cd ~/dotfiles && rake install` will link the dotfiles to their
   correct locations, backing up any versions that exist at the moment
