# Given one or more CSV files, concatenates them â€“ assuming that the
# first row of each file is a header, and therefore that it shouldn't be
# repeated between files. It's quite dumb, and assumes that you're
# trying to concatenate CSV files that make sense shoved one after the
# other (i.e. they have the same columns in the same places.)
